                        In the fast-moving, never-sleeping operations of the era, data is constantly growing. It grows
                        exponentially in quantity, it grows sideways to capture new information, and it grows into new
                        systems, platforms, and storage facilities. Throughout all of this, the importance of having
                        visibility in your data protection methods and the ability to manage, harness, store, retrieve
                        and protect it becomes as critical as it does challenging.

                    <p class="paragraph-text">

                        Relying on an in-house IT team to manage this comes with major cost-inefficiencies and
                        responsibilities that turn data protection into a full-scale department. It’s misguided to place
                        the role of data protection within the IT team, who are generalists in computer systems, as data
                        protection is a field of its own. Creating backups for data is definitely one part of the
                        solution, however, data protection also includes acting on protection gaps and disaster
                        recovery, which can fall outside of the knowledge back of traditional IT services.

                        Disaster Recover

                    <p class="paragraph-text">
                        Disaster recovery is a scenario that needs to be analyzed, modeled, or tested, which is a
                        challenging feat without the proper training and software tools. Without the resources,
                        expertise, and capabilities to model your disaster recovery, you may fall into a false sense of
                        security, relying on a backup that won’t likely restore operations after an outage.

                    <p class="paragraph-text">
                        Without a unified system, the lack of communication causes data loss vulnerabilities for highly
                        sensitive data. This is often true for company’s using IT teams to manage data protection on top
                        of their core IT competencies, as they aren’t guided to which data is critical and which is not.
                        The result is all data being treated the same, and a lack of prioritization causes high-value
                        data to fall within protection gaps and become vulnerable.

                        Data protection is just too important and too complex to not use specialist software that
                        protects this high-value intellectual property.
