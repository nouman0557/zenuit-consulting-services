                    delivers a solution to your protection and security needs. Data protection and cybersecurity are two
                    challenges that modern businesses are faced with continually. The constant stream of data through
                    networks and the always-on software platforms that run operations means they’re always a target for
                    attackers.

                    As each day goes by, data intake for an organization grows, and it can become overwhelming quickly.
                    Given the nature of what this data describes, like customer data, business plans, contracts,
                    operational data, for example, they’re one of the most important business assets and are high-value
                    intellectual property. Most businesses have a backup platform to protect this data but it’s often
                    not enough to just have these systems. They need to be efficient, easy-to-manage and prioritized so
                    that the most critical data is protected.

                    The answer to an overwhelming amount of data to process, is a unified, knowledgeable system, as
                    modern as the data-heavy times that demands its need. Meeting these three attributes is the key to
                    successful security in digital transformation:

                    Unified: The ability for the system to communicate with itself on attacks, threats, and mitigations
                    while features work together to compound protection.
                    Knowledgeable: There must be a knowledge of mission-critical data in order to prioritize its
                    protection and cover vulnerabilities.
                    Modern: New, innovative approaches are aware of rising cybersecurity threats and compliance
                    guidelines, and are typically updatable and scalable as industry best practices change.

                    Cybersecurity is the act of protecting against threats and attacks to your information systems and
                    network, to keep your critical and sensitive information secure. Cybersecurity solutions are a
                    comprehensive plan that considers how you’ll do this on an ongoing basis, with multiple systems and
                    evolving technologies and threats.

                    It’s no longer enough to look at cybersecurity as a two-dimensional act done with a simple plug-in,
                    but rather a multi-tiered operation that protects, evolves, and anticipates. While we can’t escape
                    cyber threats, our solutions create organizational resilience through buoyant security systems that
                    allow for business-as-usual every day, while threats and attacks are dealt with smoothly.
