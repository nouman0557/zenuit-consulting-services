                    Cybersecurity requires performing a particular pattern of tasks in the right order at the right

                    and efforts into cybersecurity than ever before, many aren’t seeing a proportionate rise in
                    security. It takes the understanding of your specific systems, Zenuit’s expert knowledge of the

                    The Value of Data

                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    The systems that store our information and data have become as valuable as cash flow to
                    businesses –
                    and whenever money is involved, there will always be those who want to take it from us. Networks
                    and
                    information systems do an incredible job, their programming and structure allow communication,
                    storage, and work efficiencies that we couldn’t have imagined two decades ago. But this
                    complexity
                    makes it hard to comprehend on a cognitive level, and a lack of understanding brings an equal
                    proportion of vulnerability and risks of system breaches.

                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    Vulnerabilities increase as new emerging technologies enter the world with cybercriminals
                    working
                    hard to stay as fluent in these platforms as the ones creating them. Risk can be reduced when
                    these
                    vulnerabilities are patched up, but cybercriminals are getting smarter and faster at finding
                    ways in
                    too. </p>

                    Where cyber criminals rely on a lack of understanding, Zenuit Consulting Services disarm them by

                    we work harder to be the experts in them. And when they try to harness evolving technologies,

                    ahead of the continued learning curve to set up security systems that combat their threats.

                    Cybercriminals are constantly exploring new ways to intercept data and systems. And as
