                        As data and information have become synonymous with money, cybersecurity is a crucial component
                        to running your business, and a competent cyber security consultant translates to a return on
                        investment. Zenuit Consulting Services have extensive practical experience in protecting

                        Visibility is power in cybersecurity. Assessing the state of your technology and IT systems can
                        be crucial to improving your security and knowing where to place your time and effort to create
                        a more secure network. A technology assessment outlines your risk and vulnerabilities which we
                        use to evaluate methods of protection, against your risk allowance. From here, you’ll be armed
                        with the knowledge to make the best investments for your business, and spend as little as
                        possible on optimizing your security.

                        Despite businesses spending more than ever before on security, most organizations are no more
                        secure than they were in the past. This is because their expenses are spent performing the wrong
                        actions based on a lack of knowledge.

                        threats. A risk assessment identifies where you need protection and creates a roadmap to help

                        Since so many applications and networks have moved to the cloud to store an organizations' data,
                        traditional security is no longer the only priority to an effective cybersecurity program. The
                        cloud model drives all traffic through a centralized data center, representing a channel of
                        incredible value for cybercriminals.

                        essential in keeping your security updated and protected from evolving threats. Cloud security
                        is as important to compliance regulation as badges and surveillance equipment, and businesses
                        without an effective cybersecurity program are open to significant financial and reputational

                        Penetration testing services allow you to investigate your security posture through an external
                        entrance into your systems. It’s also known as ethical hacking because of the way it penetrates
                        through vulnerable entry points to highlight and identify risks and vulnerabilities, except

                        penetration testing causes minimal disruption while mimicking the strategies of an attacker and
                        evaluating the hackability of your computer systems, web applications, or network. Penetration
