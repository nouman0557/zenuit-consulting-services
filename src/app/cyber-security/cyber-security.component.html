                        is detrimental to organizations, alongside their customers, leads, employees, partners, and
                        their profitability. So, most businesses know they need proficient protection against
                        cybercriminals, yet struggle to reconcile their investments with the small rise in the security
                        they often find that comes along with it. What’s more, wasted money pales in comparison to the
                        damage to the reputation, brand, and future prosperity of a company using the wrong approach and
                        cybersecurity technology.
